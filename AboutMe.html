            <h1>MY STORY</h1>
            <br>
            <h3>
                Before I got into yoga, I struggled both mentally and physically. Without recognizing what my mind needed, I started going to the gym to enhance my physical health. Even though I received several compliments on my body, I realized I was not truly happy without understanding why. Through the recommendation of a friend, I started going to yoga classes and a month later, saw significance changes in the way I treated myself and the people around me. I was happier and noticed a significant shift in my eating habits.

            <!-- <h3>
                Incorporating yoga in my daily routine has truly improved my physical, emotional, spiritual, and mental health and I have made it my mission to spread this positive impact to others. I have a deep passion for teaching and yoga believe that I am my best self in a classroom filled with curious minds. This is where I help them connect with their mind and body. I love combining my love of teaching and passion for yoga by sharing my knowledge with similar curious souls to experience the same happiness and peace I did.
